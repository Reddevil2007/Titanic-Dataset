# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression (From Scratch)

# 📌 Overview
This project implements a logistic regression model from scratch to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. The objective is to understand the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of logistic regression without using machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.
